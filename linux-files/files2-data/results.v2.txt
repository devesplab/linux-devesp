Initial Research Results on Search Algorithms.

Date: Tue Feb  4 09:39:16 PST 2014

It has been determined that funding for this research will be limited to
the search algorithm which will result in faster searches.

Funds will be allocated for three resources working on average 40 hours
per week. It's estimated the work will be complete in three months, but
there's also the possibility of this work could expand to include more
efficient APIs to interact with our database application. 

But a decision has not been made because it's dependent
on the search algorightm interaction with our Oracle and Cassandra databases.

The reseach will provide valuable data into the decision making process to build
a new reseach environment in the new computing facilities.
